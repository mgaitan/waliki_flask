It's a fork of Alexander Jung's `wiki <https://github.com/alexex/wiki>`_ project with few improvements:

- Extensible architecture   
- A pluggable Git backend: version control for your content!  
- reStructuredText support 
- simple caching
- autolinking of internal pages (in reST)
- an attempt of UI improve. 

Why "Waliki" ?
----------------

**Waliki** is an `Aymara <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymara_language>`_ word 
that means *All right*, *Fine*. 

It has punch, sounds a bit like *Wiki*, has a meaningful sense for this project 
and also plays with the idea of using a "non mainstream" language (*wiki* a hawaiian word) 

And last but not less important, it's a humble tribute to bolivian President Evo Morales 
who was `kidnapped <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/03/bolivia-un-evo-morales-plane>`_ in Austria.

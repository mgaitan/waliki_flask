:license: `BSD <https://github.com/mgaitan/waliki/blob/master/LICENSE>`_

At a glance, Waliki has:

- File based content. No database is required (but optional)
- An extensible architecture: almost everything is a plugin
- version control for your content using git or mercurial
- markdown or reStructuredText support
- simple caching
- UI based on bootstrap

Why "Waliki" ?
----------------

**Waliki** is an `Aymara <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymara_language>`_ word
that means *all right*, *fine*.

It sounds a bit like *Wiki*, has a meaningful sense for this project
and also plays with the idea of using a "non mainstream" language [1]_ .

And last but not less important, it's a humble tribute to bolivian `President Evo Morales Ayma <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo_Morales>`_

.. [1] *wiki* itself is a hawaiian word
